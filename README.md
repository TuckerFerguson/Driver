Entire Directory as requested

## Building the project

All project files should be in the same directory.

From the directory containing the .c source code, make the project:
    $ make

    $ sudo ./booga_load


## Features and usage

This character driver gives a stream of the following phrases:
booga! booga!, googoo! gaagaa!, neka! maka!, wooga! wooga!

## Testing

This code was tested in a very slow but organized manner such as advised in lecture. After making sure it compiled I used the included test "test-booga".

I also checked to ensure my procs were working by issuing the following command $ cat /proc/driver/booga.


### Known Bugs

I have not been made aware of any bugs at this moment.


## Reflection and Self Assessment

Although this project was relatively small in code amount it was quite difficult to debug and test.
